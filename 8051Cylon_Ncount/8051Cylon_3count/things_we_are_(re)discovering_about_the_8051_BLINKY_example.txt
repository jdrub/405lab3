 - we had to add a 1-clock delay to A11 when we used it as the BRAM select line in the 2-BRAM (e.g. 4k ROM) design. This because it appears that the 8051 CPU design starts changing address values as soon as it receives a new opcode, e.g. after only combinational logic delays through the CPU rather than synchronized to the clock. We detected this problem in the fully placed and routed design simulation when we could see the correct data coming out of the BRAM for a brief instant before A[11] prematurely switched to the (wrong) next value.  We could not see the behaviour at all in the post-translate simulation because it was instantaneous (FTL).  
 - the software placed in the .UCF file wasn't seen by the simulator in Behavioral mode therefore we need to  simulate at least post-translate in order for the code in the UCF file to be loaded into BRAM
 - the ISim configuration file 'UCF-BRAMprobe01.wcfg' placed in the project's Xilinx '\logic' directory gives a good picture of the ROM and RAM address and data bus values. 
 - the Keil C compiler adds a RAM initialization loop at program startup which loops around addresses 0x843-0x845 128 times (3.8 usec per loop) to zero the contents of RAM. It finally breaks out of the loop at 487 usec and starts executing the Cylon program. The first Cylon sweep begins at 509 usec and switches to the next sweep position at 602 usec in the 3count version of the design.
